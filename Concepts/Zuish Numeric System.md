**Zuish numeric system** was used by [[Zu]] folks to count and identify geometrical dimensions. It consists of 16 square-shaped digits (formed from different orientation of 6 unique numeric symbols), each representing a numeric value from 0 to 10. It can be seen in various places, usually written on paper, but sometimes engraved into into a surface (like on a bell in a [[Bell Island]]).

One of four artifacts is related to Zuish numbers: [[Number Cube]]. Additionally, there are several puzzles requiring the knowledge of Zuish Numeric System, namely a bell puzzle on a [[Bell Island]], the [[Crypt]] and the [[Boiler Room]].
## Structure

Zuish numeric system consists of 16 digits. However, multiple digits can correspond to the same numerical value, as presented in the image below.

From their numerical values, an interesting pattern is revealed. Each symbol is formed by drawing up to four lines from a a side of the square to the middle of it. Each line represents a numerical value - 1 for top, 2 for right, 3 for bottom, 4 for left. A total numerical value of the entire symbol is the sum of numerical values represented by the lines of that symbol.

This gives 16 unique combinations of lines, hence 16 different symbols. 

### Equation
![[Zuish Equation.png]]
Numeric symbols can be equated to each other by arranging them vertically with **`=`** symbol between them. When they're presented in such way, the numeric value of the expression the equality symbol is equal the numeric value of the expression below it.

### Addition

When number symbols are "merged" with each other vertically, they form a new numeric value, which is equal to sum of all the merged numbers. If numbers aren't merged with each other and instead are written separately (like the coordinates in the [[Zu City School#Coordinates Scroll|Zu City School]]), they should be read as a sequence of individual digits instead. As it is the case for other sequences of symbols in this game, they're meant to be first rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise before being read.

## Decyphering

[[Zu City School]] is the first step of figuring out a numerical system. In there, [[Geometric Dimension Symbols]] are paired to the numeric symbols representing a number of dimensions. Additionally, there is a tabloid showing equation `3=3` in two notations, one of which compares two different symbols representing the numerical value 3. Finally, there's a large tabletoid showing three equations, all of which add three numbers together to form a value 10. That, as well as other number-related puzzles like the [[Crypt]] or the [[Boiler Room]], and countless of equations engraved into the walls of the [[Orrery]] and [[Orrery Sub-Area]] are sufficient for figuring out the whole set of numbers used by the game.

**Zuish** script is a writing system developed by [[Zu]]. It consists of 24 square characters (6 unique symbols with 4 orientations). Plain Zuish writings are read top-to-bottom, then right-to-left. The script can be seen in various places of the world, as well as being used by its native speakers within the [[Zu City]].

Two out of four artifacts are related to Zuish language: the [[Tome]] and the [[Letter Cube]].
Additionally, the [[Security Question Room]] puzzle heavily relies on player's knowledge of the Zuish script.
## Structure
Zuish acts as a substitution cipher for English, where all 26 English letters have a Zuish counterpart. Since there are only 24 Zuish characters, two pairs of English letters share the same Zuish character (K/Q and U/V).

The image below presents English letters matched to their Zuish counterparts **as they appear in writing** (that is, with unmodified rotation).

Zuish writings, as they appear, are meant to be read top-to-bottom, then right-to left.

However, since they shares similarities of reading direction to the [[Tetromino Code]], it can be assumed that Zuish text is in fact rotated 90 degrees clockwise. This creates an alternative (probably more intended) way of reading Zuish script, which involves first rotating the entire text 90 degrees counter-clockwise, and only then matching characters to English letters.

## Deciphering

The most convenient way (and presumably the intended way) of deciphering Zuish script is by going into the [[Quick Brown Fox Room]] and matching the English [pangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram) `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`, represented physically in said level, to the writing on a [[Monolith]] in the same level.

The player is meant to understand that this script is read similarly to the [[Tetromino Code]], which requires rotating the entire writing 90 degrees counter-clockwise in order to read it.

## Observations
- Substitution happens in specific sequence - in order of the alphabet, all of unique Zuish symbols are being assigned for the first six letters, then they are rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise (except the symbol representing A, G, M and S, in which case, it's rotated clockwise) and assigned to the next 6 letters in the same order. Exceptions from this rule are characters with multiple letters assigned (K/Q and U/V) and Z being in between P and R instead of the very end.

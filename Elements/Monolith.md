![[Monolith picture.png]]
A medium-sized structure in-game which contains an information written on it, like a [[Tetromino Code]] or [[Zuish Script]]. All four sides are usually filled with an exact copy of the same information if the information itself doesn't fill it in (for instance, the monolith in [[Quick Brown Fox Room]] has a different zuish text on two walls, but it's duplicated for the remaining two).

[[Black Monolith]] is a special exception, because not only it doesn't have any visual information written on its wall, but its behavior differs from regular monoliths.

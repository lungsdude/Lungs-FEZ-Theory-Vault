An ancient artifact you collect in a [[Treasure Chest]] located in [[Quick Brown Fox Room]]. It's a red cube with different [[Zuish Script]] symbols carved on each side. 

[[Dot]] thinks the cube was used to write. However, it is uncertain what function the letter cube had in writing, since using it as a stamp would mirror symbols on the cube, and because two of them aren't symmetrical (the BHNT and EKQZX), it would result in creating invalid Zuish characters. If the cube was meant to be used directly for a writing, it would require an unconventional method like projection or stamping from within the surface you're writing on. Instead, it is more likely that the cube was used as a reference for writing Zuish texts.

Below is a wireframe image of the letter cube, unwrapped similarly to how the [[Number Cube]] is unwrapped in the [[Zu City School]].

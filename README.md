# FEZ Obsidian Vault

This is a thing that I've started some time ago, in order to collect and categorize all of the knowledge that can be gathered about FEZ and finally solve all of the remaining secrets and mysteries.

The vault is divided into separate directories:
- **Attachments** - all media (images, sounds, videos) should land there. Markdown documents can reference them from there.
- **Characters** - For characters in the game
- **Concepts** - For each abstract concept in the game that requires an explanation
- **Elements** - For each element in the game, whether it's collectible or interactable.
- **Locations** - For each region and level in the game.
- **Theories** - For unproven theories that do not fit any other directory.
## Contributing

You can edit vault files in any text editor you want, but using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is recommended, since it uses a bunch of custom tags for links and metadata.

Once downloaded, you can simply open pulled repository directory as an Obsidian Vault.
It is recommended to change attachment folder path in settings, so that images get automatically put in the Attachments directory.
If you're planning to make a small change(s), fork the repository, then make a pull request to the main branch once you're done.
If you're planning on regular updates and maintenance, let me know, and I can give you direct access to the repository.

Additionally, if you think the current structure of this project sucks, you're more than welcome to propose something better, or even restructure the entire thing yourself!

A small room functioning as a school, presumably for [[Nuzu]] residents. It contains a wire-frame of the cube, textured to resemble Earth, and three blackboards, each presenting different things:
 - a square filled with [[Tetrominos|Tetrominos]], presumably referencing The [[Hexahedron]].
 - a drawing of a creature, presumably wearing a fez, standing next to a [[Monolith]] with [[Tetromino Code]] on it. The code itself seems to be [[Tetromino Code#Invalid tetromino code|invalid]].
 - a drawing of similar creature standing next to the [[Code Machine Room#The Code Machine|The Code Machine]], surrounded by instructions on how to read [[Tetromino Code]] step by step, with each step being labeled with [[Zuish Numeric System|Zuish Numbers]].

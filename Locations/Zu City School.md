A small room functioning as a school for [[Zu]] people in [[Zu City]]. It contains posters and blackboards with a bunch of information related to the [[Zuish Numeric System]] as well as game's world and lore.

## Geometrical Dimensions Posters

One of the walls has a poster presenting [[Geometric Dimension Symbols]], linking each dimension symbol to a Zuish number of dimensions the symbol below represents.

## The Visitor Poster

The room also contains a large poster presenting what seems to be the [[Visitor]], embracing the a symbol representing a number three, which could be interpreted as the Visitor giving the [[Zu]] folk a gift of third dimension, as explained by the [[Tome]].

## Coordinates Scroll

There is a scroll containing a sequence of digits. When rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise, decoded digits read as follows:
**`33 746324`**
**`112 633553`**

If the first number is transformed into positive longitude, and the second number into negative latitude, we're getting coordinates (33.746324, -112.633553) which point to a real-world location of [The Giant Triangle](https://www.google.com/maps/place/33°44'46.8"N+112°38'00.8"W). Whether this location has any significance in the game is unknown.

## Numeric System Blackboards
The room also contains a couple of blackboards explaining and showcasing the [[Zuish Numeric System]], which explains addition and equation of the digits, as well as showing the wire-frame of the [[Number Cube]].

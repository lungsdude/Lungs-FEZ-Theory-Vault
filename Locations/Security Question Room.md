# Level name: `zu_zuish`
![[Security Question Room.png]]
A space-themed puzzle room hidden behind the doors in [[Waterfall Island]], initially submerged in the water. This room is a meta puzzle, heavily related to the [[Zuish Script]]. It contains a hovering [[Monolith]] with Zuish writings on it, along with 8 cubes with different Zuish characters carved into its walls. Solving this meta puzzle rewards the player with a [[Heart Cube]].

## Security Question

The monolith has the following text engraved into it (with punctuation added):

```
PLEASE ANSWER THIS SECURITY QUESTION: 
WHAT'S MY NAME?

SECURITY QUESTION HINT: 
MY FIRST HALF IS WHAT I AM, MY SECOND HALF IS HALF OF WHAT MADE ME
```

The player is meant to answer the security question by rearranging the Zuish letter cubes so it forms an 8-letter word on a screen. Since you can only arrange the cubes horizontally on a ground, you are actually required to "type in" the solution as if it was a Zuish writing already rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise for [[Zuish Script#Structure|decyphering]].

Given hint is essential to figuring out the answer.
`WHAT I AM` is `META`, because it is a meta puzzle.
`WHAT MADE ME` is [[Polytron]], the company who made the game. Half of it is just `TRON`.
The answer to this question is [Metatron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron), which might be closely related to [[Sacred Geometry]]. Once the player arranges the letter cubes to say that word on a ground, they will disappear, and a [[Heart Cube]] will appear.

# Level name: `zu_code_loop`
![[Code Loop Room - Yes The Whole Thing.png|200]]

A hidden-in-roots themed puzzle room inside the [[Waterfall Island]] structure, which can be accessed through a small door sealed behind the [[Destructible Walls]]. The room is **infinitely looped vertically** - this is a property unique to this room and no other room possesses it.

It contains three [[Cube Bit|Cube Bits]], one [[Golden Cube]], a [[Small Warp Gate]] and a secret [[Anti-Cube]] which can be unlocked by entering [[Tetromino Code]] hidden as a terrain of the level.

After deciphering the code, you get this input sequence:
#### `RIGHT LT RIGHT JUMP RT DOWN JUMP UP`

Executing this code in this level reveals an anti-cube above the small warp gate.

# Level name: `waterfall`
![[Waterfall Island.png]]

One of the islands near the [[Nature Hub]]. It contains a structure resembling a face, with water leaking from it, creating a waterfall.

In this area, you can find a single [[Cube Bit]] above the [[Tetromino Code]] [[Monolith]] and a one [[Bomb]]. There's also sixth [[Concentric Square Symbol]] painted on a ground on top of the structure, right in front of the tree with an entrance to the [[Quick Brown Fox Room]], which, interestingly, also has a very faint concentric square symbol on its leaves.

Additionally, an [[Owl]] saying `THE MANY ARE ONE, THE ONE IS MANY` appears at night on top of the tree on a smaller island. It's part of the [[Graveyard Owl Statue]] puzzle.

On top of that, [[Black Holes]] can appear in this area.

This area contains seven passages:
- [[Nature Hub]] passage, through the top door on a smaller island,
- [[CMY Caves]] entrance on the right side of the main structure,
- [[Mine]] entrance on the back of the main structure, sealed behind thge [[Destructible Walls]]
- [[Quick Brown Fox Room]] entrance in a tree on top of the main structure,
- [[Code Loop Room]] entrance in the top half of the main structure, sealed behind the [[Destructible Walls]].
- [[Water Wheel Room]] entrance behind the waterfall
- [[Security Question Room]] entrance, through the bottom door on a smaller island.

Several of these passages require you to complete a puzzle of sorts to be able to go through it.
## Bomb Puzzle
Both Mine entrance and Code Loop Room entrance require you to use a [[Bomb]] to blow up destructible walls blocking your way.
## CMY Caves Entry
CMY Caves require you to input a [[Tetromino Code]] which appears on a door sealing the passage, but only at night (the code, however, works regardless of whether it is day or night).

Deciphering the code yields this set of inputs: **`LEFT LT LEFT RIGHT RT DOWN UP LT`**. Inputting them reveals the passage.

## Water Wheel Room Entry
The passage to the [[Water Wheel Room]] is initially blocked by the waterfall. In order to unlock it, the player must input a [[Tetromino Code]] engraved into a monolith placed on a small island. Interestingly, this is the only Tetromino Code containing 9 symbols.

Deciphering the code yields this set of inputs: **`LEFT LT RIGHT RT UP JUMP DOWN RT RT`**. Inputting them reveals the passage by permanently splitting the waterfall stream in half.

## Security Question Room

Initially, you cannot enter the [[Security Question Room]] because it's entirely submerged in water. In order to enter it, the water level has to be first lowered with a water wheel in a [[Water Wheel Room]].

# Level name: `fox`

![[Fox.png]]

A small forest-themed room inside a tree on top of the [[Waterfall Island]]. It contains a single [[Cube Bit]] and a [[Letter Cube]] within a [[Treasure Chest]], as well as as a fox, a dog and a [[Monolith]] with [[Zuish Script]] writings on it. People have been calling this monolith a [Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone), because it is an essential part of figuring out [[Zuish Script]].
## Contained elements:
- One [[Cube Bit]]
- [[Letter Cube]]
- A stone with [[Zuish Script]] writings
- Two [[Jumpshroom]]s

## Zuish Puzzle

The room contains a physical representation of a popular English [pangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram):
`The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog`

The player is meant to notice that and try to match it to the Zuish writing on the monolith, which in turn contains every Zuish script character.

The image below presents all of the sides of the monolith. The text is segmented into two parts: `THE KUICK BROWN FOX` and `JUMPS OUER THE LAZY DOG` , which are repeated twice, presumably to fill the remaining space.

The [[Letter Cube]] is most likely there to solidify the idea that this is indeed a room with significance to the Zuish script.

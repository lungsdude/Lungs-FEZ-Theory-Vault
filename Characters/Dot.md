![[Dot image.png]]
Dot is a high-dimensional being, sent to entrust [[Gomez]] with a task of restoring pieces of [[Hexahedron]] scattered around the world after Its unexpected fragmentation in the [[Elders Room]], and to guide them in completing this quest.

Although the game does not associate Dot with any gender, Renaud BÃ©dard, one of the developers of the game, was noticed to repeatedly refer to Dot as a she.

She appears to be a three-dimensional projection of a [teserract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract), with each face having a random semi-translucent color, floating in air and rotating in a fourth dimension. She also emits gentle aura and rays of light.

Dot has a great knowledge of the necessities Gomez requires in order to progress his adventure, even going into the meta territory of guiding what inputs to press to control Gomez or how to open map and menu. However, she also seems to possess great lacks of knowledge related to the world itself and secrets related to it, often mentioning that she does not remember.

Dot is not the only one of her kind. In the [[64-bit Ending]], you can see an infinite grid of Dots flying around in a white space. This also lets us speculate if Dot is made out of other worlds, or by the very least, contains them. Additionally, one could assume the Dot which appears within the world to guide Gomez is a projection of a Dot containing that world itself.

Owls are one of the species appearing in the game. They are worshipped and feared by people living in the world of FEZ. 

During [[Gomez]]'s adventure, only four live owls seem to be present, and they all are related to the [[Graveyard Owl Statue]] puzzle. They appear only at night, except for the mentioned graveyard owl statue, where they sit forever, as the [[Graveyard]] does not have day-and-night cycle.

Apart from live owls, the world is filled with [[#Owl Statues]].
